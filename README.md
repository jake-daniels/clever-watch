Bootstraped with Create React App

## Instructions

Install: `yarn`

Run: `yarn start`

## Next Steps

- missing tests, but there isn't much domain logic for unit tests and I didn't want to spend too much time setting up E2E tests
- missing design system, so styles are not consolidated enough, there may be some code repetition present
- implemented basic responsiveness with media queries and flexbox, but there is a room for improvement
